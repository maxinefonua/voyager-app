# <img src="/assets/images/logo.svg" width="30"> Voyager Web Application

### https://demo.voyagerapp.org
A personal project I took on as a referesher of full-cycle development, and to optimize my flying benefits as an airline employee. Built entirely on open-sourced data and frameworks.

### The Problem
Flight searches on widely used platforms produce biased results that often omit smaller airlines entirely. Employees looking to utilize interairline privileges miss out on better seats when unaware of alternative paths to get to their destination.

### Minimum Viable Prototype
This application was built with the following minimum objectives:
- to present an exhaustive search of all direct and connecting flight paths between airports
- to present all available airlines for those paths and allow filtering by preference
- to suggest and add nearby airports for widened search results
